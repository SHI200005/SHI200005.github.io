It is a great idea to write all the courses I took in my fourth year in English, since we were exposed to a lot of papers and textbooks in English, although the courses were delivered in Chinese!

To summarize, the course syllabus of this course is ***, and I will arrange my post by myself.

## The Entropy of Mixing

This is the important mathematical foundation of **phase separation**.

In Statistical Mechanics ([统计物理](https://shi200005.github.io/2022/09/10/Statistical-Mechanics/)), the famous $$S=k_BlnW$$ describes the entropy of a one-component system.

Now we consider the states are characterized only by the "type" of the component. When we mix different components $$i$$, the entropy of the site-occupancy can be described by the **Boltzmann formula**, $$S=-k_B\displaystyle\sum_ip_ilnp_i$$. It comes from enumerating the microstates of given fractions of components and using **Stirling's approximation** when the number is large. More details can be found here [(En) Statistical Mechanics](https://shi200005.github.io/2023/09/10/Statistical-Mechanics/#information-and-entropy).
