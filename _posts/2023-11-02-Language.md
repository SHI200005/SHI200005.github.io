## In English

### Mathematics

- theory

  **The difference between 'theory' and 'theorem'.**

  > A **theory** is a [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason) type of [abstract thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction) about a [phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon), or the results of such thinking. ---[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory)
  >
  > In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), a **theorem** is a [statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(logic)) that has been [proved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof), or can be proved.[[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem#cite_note-2)[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem#cite_note-3)[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem#cite_note-4) ---[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem)

  Taste: **Information theory** and **asymptotic equipartition theorem**.

## From Latin

### General Writing

- i.e. [source](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/ie)

  abbreviation for "**id est**", a Latin phrase for "that is", used especially in writing before a piece of information that makes the meaning of something clearer or shows its true meaning.

  - The hotel is closed during low season, i.e. from October to March.

  - The price must be more realistic, i.e. lower.

- e.g. [source](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/eg?q=e.g.)

  abbreviation for "**exempli gratia**": a Latin phrase that means "for example".

  - You should eat more food that contains a lot of fibre, e.g. fruit, vegetables, and bread.

### Mathematics

- QED [source](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/qed?q=q.e.d)

  abbreviation for the Latin phrase "**quod erat demonstrandum**": written or said after an argument to show that you have proved something that you wanted to prove.

- *ad hoc* [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc), [source](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/ad-hoc)

  a Latin phrase meaning literally 'for this': made or happening only for a particular purpose or need, not planned before it happens: 

  - on an ad hoc basis We deal with problems on an ad hoc basis (= as they happen). 
  - an ad hoc committee/meeting 

### Life Science

- *in vivo* [source](https://www.healthline.com/health/in-vivo-vs-in-vitro)

  a Latin for “within the living”. It refers to work that’s performed in a whole, living organism.

- *in vitro* [source](https://www.healthline.com/health/in-vivo-vs-in-vitro)

  a Latin for "within the glass". When something is performed in vitro, it happens outside of a living organism.

- *in situ* [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ)

  a Latin phrase that translates literally to "on site" or "in position.

- D- and L-configurations

  D: dextro, means right; L: leevo, means left

  In chemistry, the **Fischer projection**, devised by Emil Fischer in 1891, is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional organic molecule by projection. Fischer projections were originally proposed for the depiction of carbohydrates and used by chemists, particularly in organic chemistry and biochemistry. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer_projection#:~:text=In%20chemistry%2C%20the%20Fischer%20projection,in%20organic%20chemistry%20and%20biochemistry.)

  - D-Glucose, L-Alanine.

## From Greek

### Physics

- entropy from ἑντροπία

  > In 1865, German physicist Rudolf Clausius, one of the leading founders of the field of thermodynamics, defined it as the quotient of an infinitesimal amount of heat to the instantaneous temperature. He initially described it as *transformation-content*, in German *Verwandlungsinhalt*, and later coined the term *entropy* from a Greek word for **transformation**. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy#)

  > Often called *Shannon entropy*, it was originally devised by Claude Shannon in 1948 to study the size of information of a transmitted message. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy#)

- photon from φῶς

  light.

## From German

### Mathematics

- Eigen [source]()

- Ansatz [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansatz)

  an educated guess or an additional assumption made to help solve a problem, and which may later be verified to be part of the solution by its results.

  Example: see No.4 method to [solve linear ODEs](https://shi200005.github.io/download_file/Calculus_ODE.pdf).

- Statistik [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics)

  description of a state, a country.
  
- $$\Z$$ for integers, Zählen

  to count. 

### Physics

- $$Z$$ for the partition function, Zustandssumme

  the sum over states.

- Bremsstrahlung [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremsstrahlung)

  In particle physics, *bremsstrahlung* (from German *bremsen* 'to brake' and *Strahlung* 'radiation') is electromagnetic radiation produced by the deceleration of a charged particle when deflected by another charged particle, typically an electron by an atomic nucleus. 

  If quantum effects are negligible, an accelerating charged particle radiates power as described by the Larmor formula and its relativistic generalization.

- *s-like*, senkrecht

  s and p polarization. The component of the electric filed parallel to the plane of incidence is termed *s-like*, from senkrecht, German for perpendicular.

## From French

### Physics

- propre

  > The time $$τ$$ your watch registers (or, more generally, the time associated with the moving object) is called **proper time**. (The word suggests a mistranslation of the French *“propre,”* meaning “own.”) In some cases, $$τ$$ may be a more relevant or useful quantity than $$t$$. For one thing, proper time is invariant, whereas “ordinary” time depends on the particular reference frame you have in mind. -- Griffiths' Electrodynamics, 12.2.1 Proper Time and Proper Velocity
