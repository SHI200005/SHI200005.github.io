I was writing the post [(En) Systems Biology](https://shi200005.github.io/2023/09/08/Systems-Biology/) and needed to use [``mhchem``](https://github.com/mhchem/MathJax-mhchem) for chemical reaction typing.

In this post, I will describe how to make it work. As a computer rookie, I don't know why A doesn't work but B works. By trials and errors, I know something works, but not knowing why. 

Scanning through all the files in the repository, I don't know how ``MathJax`` was enabled in this template, and we can type mathematical expressions by having ``mathjax: true`` at the beginning of each post.

In order to use ``mhchem``, go to ``\includes\header.html``, and add these lines

```
    <!-- for mhchem support -->
    {% if page.mhchem %}
    <script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
      MathJax.Ajax.config.path["mhchem"] = "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax-mhchem/3.3.2";
      MathJax.Hub.Config({
        tex2jax:{ignoreClass: "tex2jax_ignore",
                 inlineMath: [["$","$"]] },
        TeX:{ extensions:["[mhchem]/mhchem.js", "color.js"],
          noErrors:{ disabled: true } }
           });
    </script>
    <script type="text/javascript" async src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script>
    {% endif %}
```

before the end of the "head" section.

In the posts need ``mhchem``, **substitute** ``mathjax: true`` with ``mhchem: true``. Type all mathematical expressions with **only one "$" surrounding each expression**. 

The method in this post was inspired by [mhchem 使用介绍](https://wap.sciencenet.cn/blog-1213210-1240068.html?mobile=1).
