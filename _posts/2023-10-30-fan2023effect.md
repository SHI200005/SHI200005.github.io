A great opportunity for me to re-learn *Mathematical Methods for Physicists*, or even linear algebra...

## Supplemental Mathematics

The paper is [1](https://shi200005.github.io/2023/10/30/fan2023effect/#references).

The paper talks about linear models with miRNA interactions, that is, there are complex formation and disassociation (conversion). The linear models are solved under **standard linear noise approach**, which is  described in detail in my previous post [2](https://shi200005.github.io/2023/10/30/fan2023effect/#references). 

In my own [note](https://shi200005.github.io/download_file/Fan23Eff_Supp.pdf), the results of standard linear noise approach are presented, and then there are a lot of **impulse response** (check [Linear Response - (En) Biophysics](https://shi200005.github.io/2022/12/30/Biophysics/#linear-response)) to analyze fluctuations due to the reaction rates. **Laplace transform** is involved (for Laplace transform check [复变函数](https://shi200005.github.io/2022/03/28/Complex-Functions/)).
