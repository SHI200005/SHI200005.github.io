从这篇属于 Others 类别的文章，我将使用中英双语写作。

From this article, which belongs to the Others category, I will write in both Chinese and English.

## 我是谁 Who am I?

研究生某种程度上属于公众人物。我的名字、课题组和所在高校（科研机构）将成为公开信息而非隐私。尤其是这个网站上没有什么学术之外的个人生活信息。

Note that becoming a graduate student is to some extent being a public figure. My name, the group I work with and the institution I work for will no longer be a private. Especially in a place (this website) where non-private life is discussed.

我是 L Shi，2022年9月起在多伦多大学做物理学博士研究生。我的研究方向主要可以用以下几个关键词概括：理论生物物理、计算生物物理、概率论、随机过程、非线性动力学和非平衡态统计物理学。 在此之前，我在南京大学取得了理学学士学位，专业为物理学。

I am L Shi, a PhD student in physics at University of Toronto since September 2022. My research focuses on the following keywords: theoretical biophysics, computational biophysics, probability, stochastic processes, nonlinear dynamics and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. Prior to this, I obtained my BSc degree from Nanjing University, majoring in physics.

## 研究方向详情 Details of research directions

以后补充

To be added

## 网站功能扩充 Website feature expansion

我希望未来完成两个升级，一是评论区配置，二是下载功能的配置。这两个目标需要大佬直接为我提供帮助。

Two upgrades I hope to complete in the future are the configuration of the comments section and the configuration of the download area. These two goals require direct assistance from the Big Loas (sophisticated programmers).

2022.12.23 更新：下载功能已独立配置成功w

2022.12.23 Update: The download function has been successfully configured by myself lol

2023.11.05 更新：``mhchem`` 化学反应式渲染功能配置成功，详见 [(En) Configure mhchem in this Template](https://shi200005.github.io/2023/11/05/mhchem/)。

2023.11.05 Update: ``mhchem`` chemical reaction rendering function is configured successfully.

## 文章的更新  Updates to articles

在此网站建立以来，我写文章更多是为自省而非传播——不是为了教会读者什么。然而我发现，如果我能把文章的内容提升到作为自己知识系统提纲的标准，则大大提升这些文章的实用性。为此，我将为这些文章作为潜在教学工具的质量把关，而不是自己看看就得了。

In more than a year since this site was set up, I have written more for self-reflection than for spreading - not to provide an outline of knowledge for views. However I have found that if I could have an outline worth reviewing, it would be a very effective tool (even for me). In terms of form, the shift from introspection to (potentially) serving the public is mainly reflected in becoming a complete body of knowledge (i.e. adding all important conclusions), but not a personal "diary".

要完成这个转变，一个重要的技术升级便是可以在文章中利用 MathJax 打公式，在这个模板中，我们只需在每篇文章 .md 文件开头信息部分加入"mathjax: true" 这一行即可。（[MathJax symbol reference](https://bearnok.com/grva/en/knowledge/software/mathjax)）

An important technical upgrade to make this change is the ability to use MathJax to type formulas in articles. In this template, we simply add the line "mathjax: true" to the information at the beginning of each article's .md file.（[MathJax symbol reference](https://bearnok.com/grva/en/knowledge/software/mathjax)）

> 夫子盖少贬焉？——《史记·孔子世家》

研究生第一学期结束后发现很多本科时浅谈的内容在研究生被重新强调。我认为本科时没有掌握这些本该掌握的知识是正常的（也不影响考试拿高分），但是现在，我将从研究生的角度重新审视本科时写的内容，并修改更新。

After the first semester of graduate school I found that a lot of the content that I learned superficially as an undergraduate was re-emphasized in graduate school. I think it is normal not to have mastered this knowledge as an undergraduate (and it doesn't affect getting high marks in exams), but now I will revisit what I wrote as an undergraduate and revise and update it from a graduate perspective.

不论是原有文章的更新还是新文章的发布，仍主要使用中文，但会更多地标注术语的英文翻译，互联网材料引用以中文为主，也可能有英文材料。因为专业性越强，对英语的依赖性越强。

Both updates to existing articles and the release of new articles will still be mainly in Chinese, but will be more frequently marked with English translations of terms. Internet material will be cited mainly in Chinese, but may also be in English. Because the more specialised the subject, the greater the reliance on English. 

## 我是否会增加科研主题的文章 adding topics about research?

不知道呢。或许会，因为我已经是个研究生了。也可能会发布在其他平台。我是个很能写的人。

I don't know. Maybe I will, since I'm a graduate student. It might also be posted on other platforms. I'm a very capable writer.
